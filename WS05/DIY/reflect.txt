Lab:

From this part, I learnt how to do the operator overloading, constructor overloading, and
also how to define and create helper operator. I also learnt that if you want to create
standalone helper operator, you have to define make those methods as friend, so these methods
won't belong to any particular object.

overloading is a way we can reuse the operator or constructor but can get different output
if we can provide different parameters in it. It makes the code much cleaner and much easier
to maintain in the future.

When the overloaded function or operator was called, the compiler will determine the most appropriate
definition to use, by comparing the argument types you provided or operator with parameter types specified
in the definition, and this process is also called overload resolution.

From this part, I further improved my knowledge about operator and constructor overloading,
also understand under what situation we should implement our own helper operator, and it will
make our code much shorter.
