lab part:
From this workshop I further improved my knowledge about memory allocation
and memory recycle, and also understand how to assign one object to another
object. I also learnt how to write the method that required object as return type,
and also hot set public or private methods in class template.

DIY part:
From this part, I learnt that if we use pointer as our collection, we need
to allocate memory for it and recycle the memory in deconstructor, because
the memory was allocated in heap, but if we do not use vector or string,
we don't need to specify memory recycle in deconstructor, because those memory
was allocated in stack.

I didnâ€™t meet critical difficulty for this workshop, I think the most difficult part for me is
formating content output, I did spend lots of time on changing the space width among
different words.

Overrall, I think this workshop did help me improve my knowledge about OOP concepts
including encapsulation, overloading, and so on.
